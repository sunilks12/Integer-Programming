For example, team team 4 beat team 1 by a score of 38-7.  The point difference here is 31 points.  So if we compare team 4's rating to team 1's rating, r4 - r1 = 31.  This is not possible however because there are only 5 teams which leads to 5 values of r, and there were 10 games.  This means there are 5 unknowns and 10 equations, which is a system of equations that cannot be solved.  In this problem, our goal is to find the 5 unknowns that get as close as possible to satisfying the 10 equations!
